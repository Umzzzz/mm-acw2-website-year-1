<h1>Kamaal Khanum-Williams</h1>

<h2>25th Jan 2014</h2> <!-- change to date photographs taken -->

<p> For this task I had to take pictures that represent a day in my life these images that I have taken show this for example the portrait artistic this image represents a day in my life. This image is of someone that I see everyday. The camera I used to produce my images was a canon D-SLR I took all my images with this except for pop art image which was done with my Macbook.</p>

<h2>The images</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Portrait (standard)</h3>

<p> <img src="13117928/mumport.jpg" alt="portrait standard" width="400" height="494"> </p>

<p>This is the portrait image that I had taken of my mother which I took after I got home from university this image I decided to take as my standard portrait because I think that my mum at 45 years old has a photogenic face. I see my mother every day, I wanted to capture a moment in my life that I share with her on a daily basis because we are always talking about everything, and the photo I thought captures the passion look she is giving through her hands. This image I used a canon D-SLR (Digital SLR) with the Manual setting also with a shutter speed of 1/25 to capture the perfect moment without any blurs in the image. The image I used continuous capture so that as my mother posed and was comfortable to express herself the image would come out more relaxed. I took this shot with a great amount of artificial lighting to bring out the features in my mother’s face and hands. The image is taken from a more central view so that it feels as if she is looking directly at you from any angle that you see the image. In Photoshop I tried to keep the image editing of this standard image to a minimum by only changing the, “Brightness/Contrast” which slightly brought out the facial expression. </p>

<h3>Portrait (artistic) </h3>

<p><img src="13117928/smile2.jpg" alt="portrait artistic" width="400" height="470"></p>

<p>The Portrait image I took of my partner who I see every evening after university on this particular day we chose to go to my house for a meal and I saw the perfect opportunity to capture this portrait image even though it isn’t the typical type portrait I found that using two different types of lighting and colours was best to bring out the exposer on her face while using the manual camera setting. The Hue/Saturation that I used was to bring out the red, which highlights the shadow coming off her back and body. I used the same settings as the standard portrait except I used the normal one capture instead of the continuous capture, as I needed her to stay in that position. The reason that I took this image of my partner was that she is a special person in my life we spend most of our days together taking many pictures about our journeys in life. The way I took the image was using the lighting in my house as well as a spotlight on the left hand side of the image to create a contrast of colours with her as the division between both colours.</p>

<h3>Landscape</h3>

<p><img src="13117928/lighterstreets.jpg" alt="Landscape" width="600" height="194"></p>

<p>On the way home going through the town centre to my bus stop I thought I would capture the busy life of Manchester an the speed of the cars that go by. Using the tripod that I had I was able to capture the cars driving past by using the slow shutter speed so that the lights of the cars will look as they are a stream of light and gives the illusion, there not being any cars just a stream of white and red lights from the cars passing by. This image I took with the slow capture because it creates a sense of busy atmosphere that Manchester has especially at night. I also made the image lighter than the original image by increasing the brightness. The editing I kept to a minimum because the landscape image has enough going on in the image and I didn’t want to overdo the image. The reason this image relates to my life is because, I travel through the city centre every day on my way home.</p>

<h3>Object</h3>

<p><img src="13117928/boatstone3.jpg" alt="Object" width="400" height="322"></p>

<p>The object that I used was of a boat my father got for me from Netherlands last year I thought that this was a great object to use to represent a day in my life this is an object that I often look at this item in my mornings. This image I captured using my D-SLR I used the natural surroundings I found at my local park I couldn’t sit the boat as planned on the river as it almost sank. I found this rock perfect to use as a pivot to capture the boat and part of the river stream behind it. The process I took in Photoshop to get the image to this stage was by first changing the colour balance to give the image a slight blue highlight to it to bring out the reflection of the clouds on the river. Next I created a new layer flowing the first copied layer I used this layer to change the general blending option to ‘overlay’ which had opacity of 50%. The final edit I made with this image was the gradient overlay the blend mode I changed on this image was ‘subtract ‘which also had its opacity changed to 35% so that it didn’t over power the image. This image is important to me, as I like to reflect on things, which are taking place in my life when I was looking at my object it led me to think about the progress im making at university and were I can improve in my studies. The reason for taking this picture as it often allows me to become at peace with any struggles in my life.</p>

<h3>Pop Art</h3>

<p><img src="13117928/popartme.jpg" alt="Object" width="400" height="340"></p>

<p>The pop art I made for this image was of myself I took this image on my MacBook , the reason I took this image was because I thought I could show me thinking while taking the image. The reason I took the image on my MacBook was because it is something that I use a lot in my own time but I had a problem with my own camera which led me to using this. </p>
