<h2>Skating in Manchester</h2>


 
<p>This documentary provides an insite to urban sport in Manchester. We focus on skateboarding, local skaters and the skating community in city of Manchester.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Initial ideas</h3>

<p>We came up with many ideas as a group and we narrowed it down to the top three;  museums, homeless and skateboarding. We rejected the idea of the museum because it was too generic and it was taking too long to get the permission for the shoot. In addition, there were many upcoming events, which were overlapping the dates we wanted to shoot. The second choice was the homeless. We also rejected this idea because the source we were going to interview was uncomfortable with sharing his story of how he overcomes his struggles in life..</p>

<p>Finally as a group, we all decided to go with skateboarding in Manchester.  We chose to do this because it was appealing and unique. Manchester has a large skateboarding community and is very popular sport. Research included looking at different skate parks and public locations of where people skate. In addition, we looked at videos on YouTube of professional and amateur skateboarders to get ideas to how to approach our video.  We came across a well-known skater in Manchester, a person called Joe Gavin as we were browsing the internet. Another reason for choosing skateboarding as our documentary topic is that there is a lot of negativity that people have towards it. We wanted to change peopleâ€™s opinions on this subject and help them realise that there is more to the person skating. The prejudgement of a skateboarder has been going on for a long time and with personal interviews, we hoped to change this.</p>

<h3>Video synopsis</h3>

<p>Our interviewees who participate in our documentary were Ray, Rob, Shazhard Shafiq and Joe Gavin. Some of interviewees having been skating for a while, some do it as a hobby and others do it as professional career.</p>

<p>The location that was used for shooting was a public location, which was Platt field Park, and private skate park location, which was Projects. We used both public and private locations. The public location was a Council run skatepark, Platt Fields Park. The private location was Projeckts Skatepark in Manchester.</p>

<p>The job roles within the group were designated by the Team Leader, Kamaal Khanum-Williams.Kamaal and Peter Siddle directed and edited the video, Umair Yaquoob and Mike Lee were responsible for sound and interviews. Ambar Sood, Umair and Mike worked as production assistants. These roles included making sure the production worked in accordance with the storyboard previously created. All group members used the camera to achieve different shots and to gain experience using professional equipment.</p>

<p>The music used in the video was royalty free, two songs by Broke for free and Asura were found in an online <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/" target='blank'>Free Music Archive</a>. Another two songs were produced by Ismail Ghalayimi and Balraj Bharj (B Motion) who are friends of Kamaal and Peter.</p>

<h3>The critique</h3>

<p>When we started the documentary, we wanted to get two locations that did not have many distractions from others in the background. We also had to ensure we could get permission to use them. We contacted the people responsible for Projeckts Skate Park and Platt Fields Park to get this information.</p>

<p>We rejected the Manchester Museum and a story about the homeless and chose not to use these two types of documentaries. The story of the homeless we rejected because we could not find reliable people to be interviewed. We stayed focused on our final idea, skateboarding, because we all had an interest in the subject.</p>

<p>Other skate videos on YouTube gave us ideas we needed to structure our documentary when doing the production. The audience we aimed at had a negative opinion on skateboarding. 
We used the interviewees to tell the narrative and give their own story about skateboarding. Also, we used the locations to show the atmosphere. We used relevant music to relate with the skateboarding scene.The structure of our documentary was to have it based between multiple interviews telling the story of the piece. We used a mid-shot in the interviews with them sitting down to avoid the wind that was blowing in the other locations we considered.</p>

<p>We made decisions by coming together as a group and putting forward ideas to the team leader before making the final decisions on how to proceed in the project. The group was very lively with the communication and being committed to the project. 
If we were to do this again, we think as a group we would find a time in which everyone was available. One thing that did go wrong was having people fall ill and having other commitments that caused delays. The project helped the team develop skills in leadership, time management and critical thinking as well as technical media skills.</p>
